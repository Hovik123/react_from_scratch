## About

Yet another boilerplate. Originally started this as a way to learn more about Webpack,
  at this point it'll serve as a starting point for TypeScript + React projects that
  I want to play with.

Currently, this boilerplate uses:

-   Webpack 2.4.1
-   TypeScript (nightly)
-   React 15.5.4

**TODO:**

-   [ ] HMR please
-   [ ] VSCode debugger + task runner config
-   [ ] React Router
-   [ ] MobX
-   [ ] Styled Components (or CSS modules or something idk)

## Prerequisites

Global:

-   NodeJS
-   NPM/Yarn
-   TypeScript

## Commands

-   `npm run dev/yarn dev` - Spin up dev environment on <http://localhost:8080> & open browser
-   `npm start/yarn start` - Spin up production env on <http://localhost:8080> & open browser
-   `npm run build/yarn build` - Build production-ready bundle

## Errors

NPM commands not working? Some error about not being able to find webpack or
  webpack-dasboard or webpack...anything? Try installing webpack & webpack dashboard
  globally (npm i -g webpack webpack-dashboard ).
