Project Todos:
  ☐ Update README
    ☐ Explain tooling choices
    ☐ Provide quick run-through of demo app included w/ boilerplate
    ☐ Provide step-by-step guide for going from development to production
    ☐ Provide credit where credit is due (link to dependency repos)
  ☐ Potential Refactor - I'm not big on the folder structure ATM. It's not bad, but it's not great.
